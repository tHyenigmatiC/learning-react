Working:
    Lets us build out reducer functions and leverage them as state management
    inside of our components the same way as useState does. Except its going to follow 
    a similar flow of data of firing actions and those actions changing a reducer object of
    some kind; the way that we have seen of redux except localized to a component.

    Great in places where we have more complex local state management.
